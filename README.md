Welcome to the C Programs repository! This collection includes various C programs for different tasks.

## Programs

### Task 1: Swaps two numbers without using a temporary variable
   - **File:** `swap_numbers.c`
   - **Description:**
     This program swaps two numbers without using a temporary variable. It takes two integer inputs, performs the swap, and displays the updated values.

### Task 2: Calculate Years, Weeks, and Remaining Days
   - **File:** `calculate_time.c`
   - **Description:**
     This program calculates the number of years, weeks, and remaining days for a given total number of days. It provides a breakdown of the time in a more human-readable format.

### Task 3: Evaluate a Polynomial
   - **File:** `polynomial_evaluation.c`
   - **Description:**
     This program evaluates a polynomial of a specified degree with user-provided coefficients for a given value of x. It computes and displays the result of the polynomial expression.

### Task 4: Determine the middle value among three distinct variables
   - **File:** `middle_value.c`
   - **Description:**
     This program takes three distinct integer inputs (x, y, z) and determines the middle value. It prints 1 if x is the middle value, 2 if y is the middle value, and 3 if z is the middle value.

### Task 5: Check the strength of a password
   - **File:** `password_strength.c`
   - **Description:**
     This program checks the strength of a password based on specific criteria. It verifies the presence of at least one lowercase character, one uppercase character, one special character (!@#$%^&*()-+), a minimum length of 8 characters, and at least one digit.

### Task 6: Calculate if a firm can finish a project on time
   - **File:** `project_completion.c`
   - **Description:**
     This program calculates whether a firm can finish a project on time. It takes the total number of hours needed, the number of days, and the number of workers as input. The program considers training days, normal working hours, and overtime to determine if the project can be completed on time.
