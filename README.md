# C Programs

Welcome to the C Programs repository! This collection includes various C programs for different tasks.

## Programs

1. **Program 1:**
   - File: `program1.c`
   - **Description:**
     Program 1 performs the task of swapping two numbers without using a temporary variable. It takes two integer inputs, swaps them using arithmetic operations, and then displays the swapped values.
   - **Usage:**
     This program showcases a common programming exercise to demonstrate the manipulation of variables without a temporary placeholder.

2. **Program 2:**
   - File: `program2.c`
   - **Description:**
     Program 2 calculates the number of years, weeks, and remaining days for a given total number of days. It takes an integer input representing the total days and computes the equivalent years, weeks, and remaining days.
   - **Usage:**
     This program provides a utility for converting a total number of days into a more human-readable format, breaking it down into years, weeks, and days.

3. **Program 3:**
   - File: `program3.c`
   - **Description:**
     Program 3 evaluates a polynomial of a specified degree with user-provided coefficients for a given value of x. The program uses the entered degree, coefficients, and x value to compute and display the result of the polynomial.
   - **Usage:**
     This program demonstrates polynomial evaluation, where users can input the degree, coefficients, and the value of x, and it will calculate the result of the polynomial.

Feel free to explore each program's source code to understand its functionality and purpose.
